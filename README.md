# Virtual_Mouse

This project leverages OpenCV for hand tracking and gesture recognition through mediapipe and pyautogui for mouse control to create a real-time hand gesture mouse control application. Users can control the mouse cursor's movement and perform mouse clicks using hand gestures detected by the camera.
